# **Project Proposal: Weather Classification using CNN with Transfer Learning**

## Project Idea

This project focuses on developing a deep learning model that can accurately classify weather conditions (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy, sunrise, foggy) from images. The model will utilize Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with transfer learning techniques for improved performance and efficiency.

## Objectives

* Build a CNN model capable of classifying weather conditions from image inputs.
* Implement transfer learning using a pre-trained model like VGG16 to leverage existing knowledge.
* Achieve high accuracy on a dataset of weather images.
* Evaluate model performance on a separate test dataset.
* Develop a user-friendly interface (if feasible) to allow for easy image input and prediction.

## Data Sources

* **Dataset:** The project will use a dataset of weather images, including categories like sunny, cloudy, rainy, sunrise, foggy.
* **Source:** The dataset will be obtained from various online sources, including publicly available image datasets and custom collections.
* **Data Preprocessing:** Images will be resized and augmented to enhance the model's ability to generalize to different lighting conditions and perspectives.


## Methodology

* **CNN Architecture:** The model will be based on the VGG16 architecture using transfer learning.
* **Transfer Learning:** The pre-trained VGG16 model's convolutional layers will be used, and only the final fully connected layers will be trained for the specific classification task.
* **Training:** The model will be trained on a labeled dataset using techniques like Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss.
* **Evaluation:** The model's performance will be evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.


## Timeline

* **Week 1:** Gather and prepare the dataset, research and choose the transfer learning model (VGG16).
* **Week 2:** Develop and implement the CNN model, including transfer learning implementation.
* **Week 3:** Train and validate the model, tune hyperparameters for optimal performance.
* **Week 4:** Evaluate the model on the testing dataset, analyze the results, and finalize the project report. 


## Evaluation

* use vgg16 as pretrained model
* It's val_accuracy: 0.9170
* model evaluation on test data set 0.93
* It takes alot of time without gpu.
* If you don't have alot of data than use pretrained model but you need have gpu other wise it will take alot of time 4-6hour for training
